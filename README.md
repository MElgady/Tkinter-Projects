Project name: Tkinter Projects

Description: Two projects that produce a GUI with the Python Tkinter library. One project is the temp_converter that can convert temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius and back. The other project is a basic text editor which can save text files and open other text files.

Installation: To use the .py files, download the temp_converter and text_editor files in the main directory. To download the .exe files, go to the dist folder.

Usage: Open the py files in a code editor and then run. For the temp converter, you can type a number in the field you want to convert and then press the arrow. You will get the output on the right. For the text editor, you can open a file by pressing the open button or you can write some text and save a file.
